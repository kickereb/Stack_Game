# Stack_Game
Implementation of the classic mobile game on Processing Environment in java. 

Simple to initialise game where you have correctly stack a block onto another one by pressing the mouse.
The area of the recent box not being covered in the previous stack will be chipped off ultimately leading to
either exhaustion of the block or miss, either resulting in game over. However, each perfect placement will be rewarded 
by extending your block width, hence giving you a buffer to continue.
